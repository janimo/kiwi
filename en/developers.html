Kiwi Linux was started by an Ubuntu core developer, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~jani">Jani Monoses</a>. Contributors include Simona Muntean, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~csaveanu">Cosmin SÄƒveanu</a>, Gergely Imre, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~adiroiban">Adi Roiban</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~netblock">Alin-Florin Rus-Rebreanu</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~cristiklein"> Cristian Klein</a> and Mihai Brehar, who provided feedback, testing, artwork, packging, coding or hosting.</p>

<p>Obviously almost everything on the CD is the result of many years of work of volunteer and paid developers, artists, documentation writers and translators that make up the Ubuntu, Debian, GNOME, Xorg and GNU communities and the other free software projects.
